# Next.js Tattoo Removal Clinic Website Implementation

## Summary
Implement a complete Next.js website for InklessIsMore.ke, a Kenya-based tattoo removal clinic, featuring e-commerce, advanced booking system, admin panel, and ambassador program based on existing design mockups.

## Problem
The client needs a modern, frictionless web experience that goes beyond standard templates. The current legacy site needs to be replaced with a SaaS-quality user experience featuring seamless flows for package purchasing, intelligent booking, and comprehensive admin management.

## Solution
Build a self-contained Next.js application using App Router with:
- Modern UI/UX with Tailwind CSS
- Complete e-commerce flow with Stripe integration
- Advanced booking system with real-time availability
- Comprehensive admin panel
- Ambassador affiliate program
- All designs implemented from existing mockups

## Why
The existing legacy site lacks modern functionality and user experience required for competitive clinic operations. The business needs:
- Automated booking to reduce administrative overhead
- E-commerce capabilities for 24/7 package sales
- Ambassador program to drive customer referrals
- Modern admin interface for efficient business management
- Mobile-responsive design for customer accessibility
This implementation will transform the clinic's digital presence from static brochure to dynamic business platform.
